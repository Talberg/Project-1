### Inspiration
In 1906 President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act which gave the President of the United States enormous powers for "...the protection of objects of historic and scientific interest."  Recently, 3.2 million acres were taken from two National Monuments in Utah, comprising the largest rollback of protected status in United States history. These treasures have been saved for all of us, we should take advantage while they are here...
